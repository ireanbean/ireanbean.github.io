    <h5>Peer Pairing</h5>
    <p>
      Pairing at first seemed a bit uncomfortable. It may have to do with having to simultaneously pay attention to meeting and working with a new person and also make sure your computer is running smoothly. In addition, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep on knowledge and skills wise. But over time, I've paired with a couple people multiple times and some I've only paired with once. And I can honestly say now that I find it really rewarding. There is a definite feel of comraderie in expressing our understanding about the material or questioning it. I have also benefitted from my pairs' own research about random techniques in ruby, git, even in command line. There are some pairs that obviously work better together than others, but I have found that I've at least learned something from every pairing session. I never want to stop learning from others.

      Reading about myself has always been awkward. Oh, this is how x person perceives me? Oh wow, I didn't know I seemed confused to y person. And so on... The thing I love about seeing feedback though, is the constructive bits that are honest. I definitely will keep them in mind. I am now very wary of my clarity in explaining where I am taking the code if I have a suggestion or pivot from a current one!

      What's interesting is that I find it hard to leave feedback for others. It's hard to be specific but kind. I guess I just don't want to offend anyone in a harsh way, but I'm noticing after reading through others' feedback to our peers that there is a way to be critical but helpful (and not rude). I think the thing to keep in mind now is to recognize that we're all here to learn and get better and to act accordingly. There's always room for growth.
