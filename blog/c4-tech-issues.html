    <h5>The next big idea</h5>
    <p>
      We're all aware of Facebook. But ask a high schooler today if they knew about MySpace or even Friendster, and most won't have even heard about it. How is one idea patented to belong to a company? What made Facebook so successful? Who got to it first? Or is it who does it well?
    </p>

      There is a slew of articles and opinions on the interwebz about intellectual property theft that I briefly scanned over for DBC blogging sake. There have been so many law suits in this decade over what company stole what, who was the first one and should get royalties, or which billionaire owes which billionaire some $MM amount of money (as popularized by The Social Network...). Everyone wants rights to their self-proclaimed original idea. I get it. No one wants to say they copied someone else. But let's face it, it's hard to be original these days and come out with a new idea that isn't a version of something that has been done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think there is no final surgical procedure to fix this problem. I know it is a real crime to steal someone else's idea, but I think that like most solutions, this one can be solved in a grassroots movement. Instead of focusing on coming up with the next big thing or best idea or something that will garner a huge following, I think anyone who wants to and does work in the tech industry should dig deep and work for something they believe in and love. If you're in it to be the next young entrepreneur that makes it to fortune 500's richest men under the age of 30, then I have no hope for our generation. I truly feel that IP theft would be less of a problem if everyone piggybacked onto an idea that is already out there (or create one if you don't see it and recognize the need for it) and work together for that cause. There is a quote I once stumbled upon from a blog that I truly love. I hope I stick to this to the very end.<p>
      <div style="padding-left: 2em"><h4>When I was a kid, my parents took us camping. At some point, they needed a break. (I think they wanted to hump in the camper.) Dad was clever. He asked who could run up a hill, fastest. Without even finishing his sentence, we were off—we never asked why.
</p>
<p>
The smart kids in The Valley have us doing the same. We chase follows, likes, and views, but fail to consider what to do upon getting them. While the value of these metrics may be questionable, achieving them is seen as a win. Few are wise enough to ask whether these numbers matter.
</p>
<p>
Having an audience can help you get paid and that’s good. Putting your focus solely on building a following is a fool’s game, though. This pursuit of recognition is boring, and a terribly crowded race.
</p>
<p>
While you have little control over others’ attention, you have full control of what you make. So, why not put your effort into building something beautiful? Doing so is infinitely more rewarding than bombarding friends with junk. The result may even be something you can promote—should you suffer the need to do so.</h4></div>
