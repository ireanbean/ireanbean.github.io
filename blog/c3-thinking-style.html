    <h5>Life of a concrete sequential thinker</h5>
    <p>
      "Concrete sequential" is the label for my Gregorc thinking process, apparently. The concrete part means that I process information for what it is via my five senses -- touch, smell, sight, taste, and hearing. I take things for what it is with no effort to find a deeper meaning in the information beyond face value. The sequential part means that I process things very linearly in a sequential, step-by-step manner. This causes me to be very logical and prone to make plans and follow through with them vs. acting on impulse.

    <h5>So?</h5>
    <p>
      It's been three weeks (ALREADY!) at DBC. It feels silly to say, but I honestly feel like I'm on track to getting to where I want to be in life (wow, what a grand and bold statement...). Anyway, considering how my brain is wired in a concrete and sequential way, I'm wondering how this has affected my time so far in learning the material. I do know that the way the material has been presented week to week has been beneficial to me. However, since it is fast-paced and I am linear in my thought process, I tend to forget what I learned in the beginning and have to go back in my notes to check what I jotted down. This can probably be mitigated by keeping in mind the bigger picture of the week's lesson vs. keeping it very micro. Here's to week 4...!
