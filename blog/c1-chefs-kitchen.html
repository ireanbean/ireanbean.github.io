      I've always led my life, it seems, in a trial-and-error type of way. If not a, then b. If not a life as a financial analyst, then explore the medical field. If not life as a doctor, then tackle the role of content generation at a health non-profit. If not that, then this. I have grown to be perfectly okay with that.

        If there's anything that I took away from the fireside chat with Shereef, it's that DBC is definitely a group effort. Go into it with a closed mindset that you will either be the best or worst developer of your cohort, and you will lose either way. Believe that you are all cooks in the kitchen contributing and feeding off of each other, and you will grow and develop in unexpected ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        I see DBC being an environment where I can really get to know those of my cohort and improve together. I also have to recognize that I must humble myself daily and put in a good effort, regardless of the difficulty level of a challenge or the difficulty in peer pairing compatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm nervous that this turn in my life is another one of my trial and errors, but I only know that learning about being a developer has been a long-time desire of mine. I can only gain more knowledge through DBC and my cohort, and more.
