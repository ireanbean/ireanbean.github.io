    <h5>Object-oriented programming</h5>
    <p>
      It's a new year, so with a new year comes resolutions and a spike in gym attendance for the first couple of months. Let's say that you want to know how many weeks it would take to achieve your healthy pinnacle at a certain goal weight. In Ruby, it would save lines of code to create a class called Diet and create Diet#methods that would calculate all of that for you without having to write out the code each time. Take a look below.
    </p>

    <p><div style="padding-left: 2em; background-color: grey; font-color: white">
      class Diet
        attr_accessor :current_weight, :goal_weight, :pounds_lost_per_week

        def initialize(current_weight, goal_weight)
          raise ArgumentError.new ("Current and goal weight must be integers.") unless current_weight.is_a? Integer && goal_weight.is_a? Integer
          p "Your current weight is #{@current_weight}."
          p "Your goal weight is #{@goal_weight}."
        end

        def weeks_to_goal(pounds_lost_per_week)
          p (@goal_weight - @current_weight)/@pounds_lost_per_week
        end
      end
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this simple example of a class, the instance variables used are current_weight, goal_weight, and pounds_lost_per_week. To initialize the class, you must enter your current weight and goal weight as attributes. The method Diet#weeks_to_goal will take those attributes and the parameter pounds_lost_per_week to calculate how manu weeks it would take to reach your goal. If you don't initialize a new class with integer digits, it will raise an ArgumentError.
