      I've learned so much this week that it's almost overwhelming. But, here are some key takeaways that I want to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is a tool that keeps record of changes and different versions of code at different times. GitHub helps especially with version control especially when multiple people are working on the same code. It funnels “parallel universes” that are simultaneously keeping track of their own changes and people can then “push” or “pull” these versions to the master code at their choosing without messing up the original code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git tracks changes through detecting updates made in your local computer. It then asks you to save it, or "commit" it, taking a snapshot of the code at that moment in time. You can then command git to push those changes onto the remote copy online on GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub is an amazing community of developers collaborating and learning from each other. GitHub allows this to happen by providing a space for collaborators to work on the same project simultaneously without messing up the master code and feeding off of each other.
