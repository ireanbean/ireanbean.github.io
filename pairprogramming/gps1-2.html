            <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
            <p>Pair programming is collaborative effort to take on a problem with two people. It frees up brain energy to
                concentrate on a specific part of the challenge.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is Pair Programming important to Dev Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>Pair programming is important because it forces us to grow as a pair in trying
                challenges outside of our comfort zone. It creates an environment for us to point out and fix loop holes
                that we would have not seen working indiviually.

<!--Reflection:
The transition into pairing this time was much quicker since it was my second time doing a GPS. I felt very comfortable, as my partner was very good at vocalizing what he thought was good practice, etc. Our guide was very hands-off. She only spoke once at the beginning, and then when she had to leave after our hour was up. I'm not sure if that was a good sign in that we were headed in the right direction, but I do wish she would've given more guidance and/or suggestions other than answering questions about stypi and google hangouts. -->
